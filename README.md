# MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can generally be classified into three main categories: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and reinforced learning.

- **Supervised learning** algorithms learn from known datasets to make predictions or decisions about new, unseen data. The algorithm is trained on a set of labeled input/output pair to identify patterns in the data and to generalize from the examples in order to make predictions for new inputs. As more input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model the data has been fitted appropriately. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

- **Unsupervised learning** algorithms learn from unlabeled data to identify patterns and structures in the data. Unlike supervised learning, there are no explicit labels associated with the data. Instead, the algorithm discovers the inherent structure of the data and identifies clusters, groups, or other patterns. Common unsupervised learning algorithms include K-means clustering, Gaussian mixture models (GMM), and principal component analysis (PCA).

- **Reinforcement learning** algorithms learn through trial and error by interacting with an environment. The algorithm is designed to maximize a reward signal by taking actions in the environment and observing the resulting outcomes. The algorithm learns to associate actions with rewards and to adjust its behavior to maximize the reward. Reinforcement learning is commonly used in robotics, game playing, and other applications that require an agent to learn from its environment.

In addition to these main categories, there are also hybrid algorithms that combine elements of supervised and unsupervised learning, such as semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. Additionally, there are deep learning algorithms, which use artificial neural networks to learn complex representations of the data. These algorithms are commonly used in image recognition, natural language processing, and other applications.

In this series, we'll explore some commonly used ML algorithms. We'll go over what they are, what problems they can be used to solve, and walk through some examples of implementing these algorithms in Python. This series is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of the algorithms, but rather a high-level introduction. I'll leave additional references for each of the algorithms covered at the end of the post, so you can dive deeper into the math behind the algorithms if you're interested.
